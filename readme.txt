Enables Shortcodes for SEO or embedded deployment of Caspio cloud computing database applications.

== Description ==

Caspio is an online database featuring web-based tools for designing database tables, forms, reports, charts and graphs, and more complicated applications like store locators with Google Maps mashups. Applications can be created without programming, and embedding them in your website is as easy as copying and pasting a code snippet.

The Caspio Deploy2 plugin enables ShortCode placeholders that further streamline the deployment of Caspio applications. The shortcodes can be used for SEO deployment of content, as well as embedding the AJAX widget used to display Caspio forms. Caspio Deploy2 replaces the earlier Caspio Deployment Control plugin (which did not use shortcodes).

The `[caspio]` shortcode can be wrapped around the standard block of code generated by Caspio Bridge for SEO Deployment. You should toggle from the Visual to HTML mode of the WordPress editor before pasting in the block of code, but it will work even if you paste the code into the Visual editor.

Example:

`[caspio]
<!-- Begin Caspio Deploy Code (for inserting in body) -->
<?php require_once('http://b4.caspio.com/scripts/dpload.txt');dpload('http://b4.caspio.com/','5F422000c3f2d8h4d3c9f4b9g9e0','l');?>
<!-- End Caspio Deploy Code -->
[/caspio]`

Alternatively, you can cut out everything except the parameters for the dpload function (make sure to include the quotes around each parameter):

`[caspio]
'http://b4.caspio.com/','5F422000c3f2d8h4d3c9f4b9g9e0','l'
[/caspio]`

Or the parameters from the dpload function can be embedded in the shortcode tag as follows:

`[caspio url="http://b4.caspio.com/" key="5F422000c3f2d8h4d3c9f4b9g9e0" style="l"]`

For Caspio application deployment in embedded mode, you can use this shortcode placeholder which will be replaced at runtime with the standard Caspio JavaScript widget. This lets you avoid having the JavaScript code scrambled by the WordPress editor in Visual mode.

`[caspio embed="https://b4.caspio.com" key="5F422000i9f9a0h4e2i7c9g6c9c3"]`

1. Copy the resulting caspio-deploy2 directory into /wp-content/plugins/
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu of WordPress

= Where do I get support and other information about Caspio Bridge? =

For support and other information about Caspio Bridge, see the Caspio official site at [http://www.caspio.com](http://www.caspio.com "Caspio official site"), Caspio Bridge overview at [http://www.caspio.com/bridge/](http://www.caspio.com/bridge/ "Caspio Bridge Overview") and Caspio support page at [http://www.caspio.com/support/](http://www.caspio.com/support/ "Link to Caspio support page").

== Screenshots ==

1. Paste the deployment code snippet in between the `[caspio][/caspio]` tags for smooth deployment in WordPress. Shown here is the standard PHP code snippet for SEO Deployment. For security reasons, the PHP code is not executed directly, but the plugin extracts the server url and application key parameters it needs to function. The same technique works for pasting a JavaScript snippet between `[caspio][/caspio]` tags to avoid having the code scrambled by the WordPress editor in Visual mode. 
2. Alternately, you can use the more concise format `[caspio url="CaspioServerURL" key="CaspioAppKey" style="l"]` (for SEO Deployment) or `[caspio embed="CaspioServerURL" key="CaspioAppKey"]` (embed JavaScript widget, note the parameter name `embed` instead of `url`). This shows where you can find the server url variable by toggling the Deployment wizard to Direct from Caspio.
